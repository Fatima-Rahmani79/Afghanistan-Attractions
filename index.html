            <h3>Darul Aman Palace, Kabul</h3>
            <img
              src="assets/images/darolaman.jpg"
              alt="Darulaman Palace, Kabul"
            />
            <p>
              Darul Aman Palace, built in the 1920s under King Amanullah Khan,
              is a symbol of Afghanistan’s drive for modernization. Designed in
              a neoclassical European style, the palace once stood as a center
              of reform and progress. Over the decades, it suffered heavy damage
              due to war and political unrest. <br />
              In recent years, the palace was fully restored and reopened in
              2019. Today, it stands proudly as a cultural landmark in Kabul,
              welcoming visitors to witness Afghanistan’s rich history and
              architectural heritage.

            <img src="assets/images/bandeAmir2.jpg" alt="Bande Amir, Bamyan" />
            <p>
              Band-e Amir is Afghanistan’s first national park, located in the
              central highlands of Bamiyan province. It consists of a series of
              stunning deep blue lakes, formed naturally by mineral-rich water
              and surrounded by majestic mountains. The breathtaking beauty and
              peaceful atmosphere of Band-e Amir make it one of the country’s
              most iconic natural attractions.
              <br />
              Recognized for its ecological and cultural significance, the area
              attracts both domestic and international tourists seeking nature,
              serenity, and adventure in the heart of Afghanistan.

            <h3>Herat – The Cultural Heart of Western Afghanistan</h3>
            <img src="assets/images/herat3.jpg" alt="Herat" />
            <p>
              Herat, one of Afghanistan’s oldest and most historically rich
              cities, is a treasure trove of Islamic architecture, art, and
              culture. From the majestic tomb of Khwaja Abdullah Ansari in
              Gazargah to the elegant Khwaja Parsa Mosque, Herat reflects
              centuries of spiritual and architectural heritage. The towering
              Herat Minarets, remnants of the ancient Musalla Complex, stand as
              silent witnesses to the city’s glorious past.
              <br />
              With its vibrant bazaars, historic cityscapes, and deep-rooted
              traditions, Herat continues to enchant visitors, offering a unique
              glimpse into Afghanistan’s cultural soul.

            <h3>Panjshir Valley – The Valley of Heroes</h3>
            <img src="assets/images/Panjshir-Valley.jpg" alt="Panjshir" />
            <p>
              Panjshir Valley, nestled in the northeastern mountains of
              Afghanistan, is renowned for its breathtaking natural beauty and
              deep historical significance. Surrounded by snow-capped peaks and
              lush greenery, the valley is a symbol of resilience and pride in
              Afghan history. It is especially known as the homeland of Ahmad
              Shah Massoud, the national hero, and has long been a center of
              resistance and strength.
              <br />
              Today, Panjshir welcomes visitors with its serene landscapes,
              flowing rivers, and a powerful spirit that echoes through its
              mountains.

            <h3>Bamiyan Buddhas – Silent Guardians of History</h3>
            <img src="assets/images/botebooda.jpg" alt="Buddah of Bamiyan" />
            <p>
              The Bamiyan Buddhas were two monumental statues carved into the
              cliffs of the Bamiyan Valley over 1,500 years ago. Once standing
              at 38 and 55 meters tall, these majestic figures represented the
              rich Buddhist heritage that flourished in the region before the
              arrival of Islam.
              <br />
              Though tragically destroyed in 2001, the empty niches where the
              Buddhas once stood continue to tell a powerful story of ancient
              civilization, cultural coexistence, and the resilience of history.
              Today, the site is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and remains a
              symbol of both loss and hope.
